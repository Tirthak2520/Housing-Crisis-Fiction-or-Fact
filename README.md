# Housing Crisis Fact or Fiction?
## Project Summary

* In order to close the gap between perception and fact, I oversaw a thorough investigation of the Canadian housing market as the principal investigator for the "Housing Crisis in Canada: Fact or Fiction?" project. 
* Our project provides a perceptive and accurate representation of the difficulties encountered by people and communities across the country by carefully examining historical processes and significant factors to the crisis. As part of my work, I also had to translate difficult information into easily understood visual representations for a wide audience. By forecasting the housing market's course for 2023–2024, I helped to take a forward-looking strategy and helped stakeholders, decision-makers, and the general public navigate changing dynamics.

## Objective & Goals:

The primary objective of our project “Housing Crisis in Canada: Friction or Fact? " Is to critically assess
the housing crisis in Canada, differentiating between perceived notions and the actual impact. We aim
to investigate whether the housing crisis is substantiated by empirical evidence or if it has been
amplified by selective media coverage and influential figures. By conducting a rigorous analysis, we seek
to provide a well-rounded understanding of this issue, shedding light on its root causes, extent, and
implications for Canadians.

## Interpretation
The housing crisis in Canada appears to be a tangible reality rather than a mere fiction. The available data points towards a substantial and persistent surge in housing-related challenges. Factors such as escalating property prices, a notable increase in demand, and limited affordability underscore the severity of the situation. The prevalence of issues like homelessness, bidding wars, and an insufficient housing supply further solidifies the interpretation that Canada is indeed grappling with a genuine housing crisis. 

## Model Used
1.	Construction Activity: Construction activity is anticipated to respond to the evolving demand for housing infrastructure. In regions experiencing population growth and rising housing prices, construction activity is likely to increase to meet the demand for new housing units. Conversely, areas with stagnant population growth or oversupply conditions may see a slowdown in construction activity. The model incorporates variables such as population forecasts, housing market indicators, and regulatory frameworks to project construction trends.
2.	Crisis Assessment: By integrating predictions for population growth, housing prices, and construction activity, stakeholders can assess the likelihood of a housing crisis in Canada. Key indicators such as rapid population growth coupled with stagnant construction activity and soaring housing prices in certain regions may signal the emergence of a crisis. Conversely, balanced population growth, stable housing prices, and proactive construction activity suggest a more resilient housing market. The model enables policymakers and stakeholders to monitor these indicators and implement timely interventions to mitigate the risk of a housing crisis.
3.	Population Growth: The LSTM-based population forecasting model predicts a steady increase in the population of Canada over the next decade. Factors such as immigration, birth rates, and economic conditions are likely to contribute to this growth trend. By analyzing historical data and projecting future trends, the model estimates the magnitude of population growth in different regions of the country.


## Final Results
Regional Disparity: The housing crisis manifests differently across provinces as well cities, with varying degrees of impact.
British Columbia: Registers a modest 3.5% crisis rate, with declining trends. However, high house and land prices pose affordability challenges in this province.
Manitoba: Faces the most acute crisis, potentially overshadowed by media focus on Ontario.
Ontario: Surprisingly, the crisis rate is around 20%, diverging from media and public perception.
Price Dynamics: Across most provinces, house prices surge while land prices remain relatively stable, highlighting the complex dynamics of the housing market.


By acknowledging these multifaceted dimensions, our project seeks to contribute to a holistic understanding of the housing crisis in Canada and advocate for comprehensive solutions that address the real and pressing needs of the population.
